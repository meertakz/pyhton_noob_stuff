>> A Munodi sequence is a sequence of integer numbers  where C[n+1]=C[n]/2 if C[n] is even or C[n+1]=3*C[n]+1  if C[n] is odd. The sequence teminates when 1 appears.

>> Note: Munodi sequence is guaranteed to be finite.

>> Given the file containing an unknown number of integer sequences, one per line, with number separated by spaces; write a Python program that check if the sequences are Munodi sequences and print the result on the screen.
